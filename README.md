## Git Line Endings Warning (Windows Users)

If you see this warning when committing:

```
warning: in the working copy of 'public/scripts/lazy.sh', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it
```

This is Git notifying you about line ending conversions between Unix (LF) and Windows (CRLF).

To fix or avoid this warning, you can:

1. Configure Git to handle line endings consistently:

   ```bash
   git config --global core.autocrlf input
   ```

2. Add a `.gitattributes` file to your project root with:

   ```
   *.sh text eol=lf
   ```

3. Convert existing files to LF line endings using tools like `dos2unix` or editor features.
